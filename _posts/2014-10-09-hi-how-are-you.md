Okay, I've decided to teach myself the *serious* computer science concepts that,
as an EE major, I missed out on in college. Since the best way to learn a subject
is to teach it, I'll be using this blog as a way to solidify in my mind the concepts
I study. Perhaps others may find the following articles useful, or perhaps I'm just
talking to myself, but either way, the goal is for it to make me a better programmer.

So here goes nothing.
